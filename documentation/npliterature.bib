abstract = {A nanopore-based device provides single-molecule detection and analytical capabilities that are achieved by electrophoretically driving molecules in solution through a nano-scale pore. The nanopore provides a highly confined space within which single nucleic acid polymers can be analyzed at high throughput by one of a variety of means, and the perfect processivity that can be enforced in a narrow pore ensures that the native order of the nucleobases in a polynucleotide is reflected in the sequence of signals that is detected. Kilobase length polymers (single-stranded genomic DNA or RNA) or small molecules (e.g., nucleosides) can be identified and characterized without amplification or labeling, a unique analytical capability that makes inexpensive, rapid DNA sequencing a possibility. Further research and development to overcome current challenges to nanopore identification of each successive nucleotide in a DNA strand offers the prospect of 'third generation' instruments that will sequence a diploid mammalian genome for approximately {\$}1,000 in approximately 24 h.},

abstract = {Nanopores hold great promise as single-molecule analytical devices and biophysical model systems because the ionic current blockades they produce contain information about the identity, concentration, structure, and dynamics of target molecules. The porin MspA of Mycobacterium smegmatis has remarkable stability against environmental stresses and can be rationally modified based on its crystal structure. Further, MspA has a short and narrow channel constriction that is promising for DNA sequencing because it may enable improved characterization of short segments of a ssDNA molecule that is threaded through the pore. By eliminating the negative charge in the channel constriction, we designed and constructed an MspA mutant capable of electronically detecting and characterizing single molecules of ssDNA as they are electrophoretically driven through the pore. A second mutant with additional exchanges of negatively-charged residues for positively-charged residues in the vestibule region exhibited a factor of approximately 20 higher interaction rates, required only half as much voltage to observe interaction, and allowed ssDNA to reside in the vestibule approximately 100 times longer than the first mutant. Our results introduce MspA as a nanopore for nucleic acid analysis and highlight its potential as an engineerable platform for single-molecule detection and characterization applications.},

Initially, overlaps between nanopore reads are detected. Reads are then subjected to one or more rounds of error correction by a multiple alignment process employing partial order graphs. After correction, reads are assembled using the Celera assembler. We show that this method is able to assemble nanopore reads from Escherichia coli K-12 MG1655 into a single contig of length 4.6Mb permitting a full reconstruction of gene order. The resulting assembly has 98.4{\%} nucleotide identity compared to the finished reference genome.},

abstract = {Cytosine, 5-methylcytosine, and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine were identified during translocation of single DNA template strands through a modified Mycobacterium smegmatis porin A (M2MspA) nanopore under control of phi29 DNA polymerase. This identification was based on three consecutive ionic current states that correspond to passage of modified or unmodified CG dinucleotides and their immediate neighbors through the nanopore limiting aperture. To establish quality scores for these calls, we examined {\~{}}3,300 translocation events for 48 distinct DNA constructs. Each experiment analyzed a mixture of cytosine-, 5-methylcytosine-, and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine-bearing DNA strands that contained a marker that independently established the correct cytosine methylation status at the target CG of each molecule tested. To calculate error rates for these calls, we established decision boundaries using a variety of machine-learning methods. These error rates depended upon the identity of the bases immediately 5' and 3' of the targeted CG dinucleotide, and ranged from 1.7{\%} to 12.2{\%} for a single-pass read. We estimate that Q40 values (0.01{\%} error rates) for methylation status calls could be achieved by reading single molecules 5-19 times depending upon sequence context.},

abstract = {Motivation: Nanopore sequencing may be the next disruptive technology in genomics. Nanopore sequencing has many attractive properties including the ability to detect single DNA molecules without prior amplification, the lack of reliance on expensive optical components, and the ability to sequence very long fragments. The MinION from Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) is the first nanopore sequencer to be commercialised and made available to early-access users. The MinION(TM) is a USB-connected, portable nanopore sequencer which permits real-time analysis of streaming event data. A cloud-based service is available to translate events into nucleotide base calls. However, software support to deal with such data is limited, and the community lacks a standardized toolkit for the analysis of nanopore datasets. Results: We introduce poretools, a flexible toolkit for manipulating and exploring datasets generated by nanopore sequencing devices from MinION for the purposes of quality control and downstream analysis. Poretools operates directly on the native FAST5 (a variant of the HDF5 standard) file format produced by ONT and provides a wealth of format conversion utilities and data exploration and visualization tools. Availability and implementation: Poretools is open source software and is written in Python as both a suite of command line utilities and a Python application programming interface. Source code and user documentation are freely available in Github at https://github.com/arq5x/poretools Contact: n.j.loman@bham.ac.uk, aaronquinlan@gmail.com Supplementary information: An IPython notebook demonstrating the use and functionality of poretools in greater detail is available from the Github repository.},
